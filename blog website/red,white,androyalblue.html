            <h4><strong>Review</strong></h4>
                <p>Initially I didn't think I was going to like this book because it's in third person, however it read as if I was right there with the characters. Despite this book having a lot of political talk, it was really funny and enjoyable. All of the characters were so real feeling. My absolute favorite part of this book was the email and text threads between the characters, I feel they made this book feel more real and helped me connect with the characters.</p>
