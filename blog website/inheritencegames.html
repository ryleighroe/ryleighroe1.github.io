            <h4><strong>Review</strong></h4>
                <p>For a YA book this was surprisingly really fun. I love that Avery is such a strong female character and wasnt rocked by the events that took place. The Hawthorne brothers were such a fun group of siblings. I loved how each brother has a totally different personality. While reading this I was baffled at how Jennifer Lynn Barnes could write something with so many layers and not make it boring.</p>
